## Introduction


This project _printf function in C, is our first collaborative
work in programming at Holberton School.



It will permit us to understand well variadic functions in C.

Our secret for the _printf project is a well-structured departure
We have solved problems before start coding to know exactly what are we going to code.

Then, start coding this project on the way Paris/Toulouse the 11th of March 2022
In the train for reach, le "Salon de l'etudiant 2022 " to represent Holberton School and share our passion with futur students visiting the Salon Studyrama.
  
 



## Steps

First of all, we drawn a flowchart
This allows us for a more global vision and to record tasks more quickly

Those are the format identifier's needed to write:

%  | type |
---|------|
%c | character				|
%s | string					|
%p | pointer				|
%d | decimal signed integer	|
%i | integer				|
%u | unsigned integer		|
%x | hex integer (lowercase)|
%X | hex integer (uppercase)|
%% | just the %				|

## We handle in this project
--- the flags:
--- the field width
--- the precision
--- the length modifiers
--- and custom conversion specifiers







## Flowchart


## Integers



## Decimal to hexadecimal conversion
